# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Deployment

**Purpose:**  
This document outlines the process and timeline for code-level and production-level deployments to ensure smooth and efficient releases with minimal disruptions.

---

### 1. **Code-Level Deployment (Branch Merging to Main)**

**Objective:**  
Developers can continually merge their individual branch to **develop** branch 
Merging of code from **develop** branch to the **main** branch is teremed **DEPLOYMENT** to keep the main branch up to date and ready for production deployment.

**Deployment Days:**

- **Monday (Recommended):**  
  The ideal day to perform code merging. This ensures the week starts with the latest changes and allows time to resolve any issues before the end of the week.
  
- **Tuesday (If Mondayâ€™s Merge Fails):**  
  If merging didnâ€™t happen on Monday due to any unforeseen reason, Tuesday is the second-best option to complete the task. Any delays beyond Tuesday could impact the weekâ€™s work.

- **Wednesday (Late Deployment):**  
  Merging on Wednesday is considered late and should be avoided if possible. Delays can cause a backlog in tasks and result in fewer available days to address any arising issues.

- **Thursday (Not Recommended, Except for Critical Reasons):**  
  Avoid merging on Thursday unless there is a critical update that must be applied. Any issues arising from Thursday merges may not be addressed before the weekend, risking weekend downtime.

- **Friday (No Deployment):**  
  No code-level deployment should be done on Fridays. Developers typically leave earlier for the weekend, and any deployment issues could lead to prolonged downtimes. Reserve Fridays for planning or fixing minor bugs if needed.

**Developer Standby:**  
During the deployment process, **all developers** are expected to remain on standby until the process is successfully completed. Developers should be ready to troubleshoot and address any issues that arise during the deployment.

---

### 2. **Production Level Deployment**

**Objective:**  
Deploy code to live servers, ensuring the system is up and running smoothly for end users. This also involves handling critical bugs or urgent fixes that need to be deployed immediately.

**Deployment Process:**

- **Not Done by Developers:**  
  Production-level deployment is **not performed by developers** directly. Instead, this responsibility is handled by the designated team, typically the **DevOps team** or a similar group with the necessary access and expertise to deploy to live servers.

- **Critical or Urgent Fixes:**  
  In the case of critical bugs or urgent issues affecting the live system, the DevOps team is notified immediately, and the deployment is prioritized. This may happen outside of regular deployment schedules but requires careful coordination with the development team to ensure that the fix is correctly implemented.

---

### General Guidelines for Deployment:

1. **Communication:**  
   Always inform the team about the scheduled deployment days, especially if there are any changes. Clear communication helps ensure that everyone is on the same page.

2. **Backups:**  
   Before initiating any deployment, ensure that proper backups of databases and key services are in place. This is crucial for recovery if anything goes wrong during the deployment.

3. **Testing:**  
   Code should be thoroughly tested in staging or pre-production environments before being merged or deployed to production. Any known issues should be resolved in advance to avoid unnecessary delays.

4. **Post-Deployment Monitoring:**  
   Once the deployment is completed, ensure that the system is monitored closely for any errors or issues that might arise. Developers should be on standby for any hotfixes or adjustments needed.

---

By following this SOP, we ensure that code deployments are done in a structured, organized, and efficient manner, minimizing risks and maximizing team productivity.

# Github Repository, Folder and File Naming  ðŸ‘€

## Overview

This policy outlines the repository naming conventions for all projects under our organization. Adhering to this naming convention ensures consistency, clarity, and ease of management across our repositories. Non-compliance with this policy may result in restricted actions or notifications for remediation.

---

## Naming Convention

Each repository name must follow the pattern:

```
[SUFFIX]-[PROJECT]-[MODULE]

```



### Definitions:

- **SUFFIX**: Specifies the category or layer of the application. Must be one of the following:
    - `backend`
    - `middleware`
    - `frontend`
    - `mobileapp`
- **PROJECT**: Represents the project name. Must be one of the following:
    - `middey`
    - `rimplenet`
    - `nellalinksbs`
    - `nellalinktest`
- **MODULE**: Identifies the specific functionality or module. Must be one of the following:
    - `user-app`
    - `admin-app`
    - `kyc-verification`
    - `validate-transaction`

### Example Valid Names

- `backend-middey-user-app`
- `middleware-nellalinksbs-kyc-verification`
- `frontend-nellalinktest-admin-app`
- `mobileapp-middey-android`
- `mobileapp-middey-ios`

--

## Enforced Validation

The naming convention is enforced using a GitHub Action workflow. The workflow validates the repository name whenever a repository is created or a push is made. If the name does not follow the required pattern:

1. The workflow will fail.
2. A Slack notification will be sent to alert the relevant team;

---

## Validation Workflow Details

### Trigger Events:

- Repository creation (`create` event).
- Code push (`push` event).

### Validation Steps:

1. Extract the repository name components.
2. Validate each component against the defined lists:
    - `SUFFIX` must match one of the valid suffixes.
    - `PROJECT` must match one of the valid project names.
    - `MODULE` must match one of the valid module names.
3. If validation fails, the workflow:
    - Outputs the specific error.
    - Sends a Slack notification with details of the failure.

### Example Slack Notification:

```
The repository name 'invalid-repo-name' does not follow the valid naming convention. Please update the repository name to follow the required pattern: [SUFFIX]-[PROJECT]-[MODULE].

```

---

## Developer Actions for Compliance

### When creating a new repository:

- Ensure the repository name adheres to the naming convention.
- Use the provided lists for valid suffixes, projects, and modules.

### If the workflow fails:

1. Check the error message for details on which part of the name is invalid.
2. Rename the repository to comply with the naming convention.
3. Push changes or retry actions after renaming.

---

## Reference Implementation (Draft Not Tested)

The validation is implemented as part of the GitHub Action workflow:

```yaml
name: Enforce Valid Repository Name


on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      slack-token:
        required: false
        type: string
      channel-id:
        required: false
        type: string

jobs:
  validate-name:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Validate Repository Name
        shell: bash
        env:
          REPO_NAME: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
         
        run: |
          # Define valid suffixes
          VALID_SUFFIXES=("backend" "middleware" "frontend" "mobileapp" "org")
          
          # Define valid project names
          VALID_PROJECTS=("middey" "nellalinksbs" "nellalinktest" "rimplenet" "workflow")
          
          # Define valid modules
          VALID_MODULES=("user-app" "admin-app" "kyc-verification" "validate-transaction" "sop-templates" "cryptoengine")
          
          # Extract parts of the repository name
          SUFFIX=$(echo "$REPO_NAME" | cut -d- -f1)
          PROJECT=$(echo "$REPO_NAME" | cut -d- -f2)
          MODULE=$(echo "$REPO_NAME" | cut -d- -f3-)
          
          # Check if SUFFIX is valid
          if [[ ! " ${VALID_SUFFIXES[@]} " =~ " $SUFFIX " ]]; then
            echo "Error: Invalid suffix '$SUFFIX'. Must be one of: ${VALID_SUFFIXES[@]}."
            exit 1
          fi
          
          # Check if PROJECT is valid
          if [[ ! " ${VALID_PROJECTS[@]} " =~ " $PROJECT " ]]; then
            echo "Error: Invalid project name '$PROJECT'. Must be one of: ${VALID_PROJECTS[@]}."
            exit 1
          fi
          
          # Check if MODULE is valid
          if [[ ! " ${VALID_MODULES[@]} " =~ " $MODULE " ]]; then
            echo "Error: Invalid module name '$MODULE'. Must be one of: ${VALID_MODULES[@]}."
            exit 1
          fi
          
          echo "Repository name '$REPO_NAME' is valid."

      - name: Send Slack Notification on Invalid Repository Name
        if: failure()  
        uses: distributhor/workflow-webhook@v3
        with:
          webhook_url: https://api.jubbytech.com/webhook/
          webhook_secret: '4544af'
          data: '{"title": "Invalid Repository Name Detected","text": "The repository name does not follow the valid naming convention.","repo": "${{ github.event.repository.name }}","format": "[SUFFIX]-[PROJECT]-[MODULE]"}'

```

# Proposed Naming conventions/Patterns for:

1. **Files/Folders** 
2. **Branching**
3. **Commit Messages**

---

### **1. Naming Conventions**

### **Files and Folders**

- Use lowercase with hyphens for file and folder names.
    - Example:
        - `user-profile.js`
        - `order-details/`
- Group files logically by feature or module.
    - Example:Â `features/user-management/`,Â `components/header/`

### **Database Tables**

- Use snake_case for table and column names.
    - Example:Â `user_profiles`,Â `created_at`

---

### **2. Standardized Branching Strategy**

### **Git Flow Example**

- **Main Branches**:
    - `main`: Always stable, contains production-ready code.
    - `develop`: Integration branch for ongoing development.
- **Feature Branches**:
    - Naming:Â `feature/<feature-name>`
        - Example:Â `feature/add-user-authentication`
- **Bugfix Branches**:
    - Naming:Â `bugfix/<ticket-id>-<bug-description>`
        - Example:Â `bugfix/1234-fix-login-error`
- **Release Branches**:
    - Naming:Â `release/<version-number>`
        - Example:Â `release/1.2.0`
- **Hotfix Branches**:
    - Naming:Â `hotfix/<ticket-id>-<description>`
        - Example:Â `hotfix/5678-critical-payment-bug`

---

### **3. Writing Meaningful Commit Messages**

### **Structure:**

```
<type>: <short description>

<body>

```

### **Types**:

- `feat`: A new feature.
- `fix`: A bug fix.
- `refactor`: Code change that does not fix a bug or add a feature.
- `docs`: Changes to documentation.
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests.
- `chore`: Routine task (e.g., updating dependencies).

### **Examples**:

1. `feat: add user authentication`
    - Body: "Implemented login, registration, and logout functionality using OAuth."
2. `fix: resolve null pointer exception in OrderService`
    - Body: "Added null checks to avoid crashes when order ID is invalid."
